Derp is an experimental cross-platform installer for doing neat stuff.
Right now, it's still experimental, so don't run it on important
computers or devices.  In fact, unless you're a developer, you're
advised to not run it at all.

Note that right now, uninstalling Derp will *not* auto-remove the Android SDK.

See the included Tutorial, FAQs, and other documentation, available from within
Derp itself for help on using Derp and writing .derp scripts.


BUILDING DERP

You'll need Python 2.7 or so and wxwidgets installed onto any computer
used to build DERP.  Additionally you'll need a toolchain.

--DEBIAN/UBUNTU/MINT--

For debian-based Linux, you need the usual .deb-making tools.  Something
like this should get you started:

sudo apt-get install make build-essential devscripts python-all debhelper python-wxgtk2.8

--MAC OS X--

On mac, wxwidgets 2.9 or higher (for cocoa) is required.  You can use Xcode or install
the toolchain yourself from http://gcc.gnu.org/ or a prepackaged source.


More info will have to follow later.  Essentially, though.... to build:

make debian -- makes a debian .deb for installation
make mac    -- makes a mac .app  (only tested in Snow Leopard)


RUNNING FROM THE DIRECTORY:

To run from the main source directory (in Linux), cd to the /derp directory, then:

sudo python src/derp.py
