*** BECAUSE IT IS A SOFTWARE INSTALLER, DERP NEEDS TO BE RUN
WITH ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGES.  IT MAY BE SAFEST TO DO THIS
FROM A VIRTUAL MACHINE OR A COMPUTER YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT.
BE WARY OF RUNNING UNTRUSTED SCRIPTS AS IT WILL HAVE FULL
ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER AND DEVICES.  SEE THE LICENSE FOR
DISCLAIMERS AND REMEMBER YOU RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK ***


For right now, it's not even worth describing what DERP
is in too much detail, as it's still new and experimental
and potentially dangerous and you probably shouldn't use it.


BUILDING DERP


You'll need Python 2.7 or so and wxwidgets installed on any computer
that you wish to build DERP.  On mac, wxwidgets 2.9 or higher is needed.

Additionally you'll need a toolchain installed.  For debian, you need the
usual .deb-making tools.

More info will have to follow later.  Essentially, though.... to build:


make debian -- makes a debian .deb for installation
make mac    -- makes a mac .app 


To run from the main source directory:

sudo python src/derp.py


   --fattire
